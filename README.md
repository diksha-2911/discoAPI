# discoAPI
# This is the repository for team Midnights. On this weeks theme for HackNight that is DiscordAPIs we have attempted to build a bot called Query_bot.
# The functionality of the bot can be described as follows:
# 1. the bot will allow the user to ask any coding related and query and serve the user with the top five website links the answer that query the best.
# 2. THe user need not go to the internet for clearing his/her doubt everytime they face a difficulty while they are live streaming or even participating in a hackathon and look for the resources all at one place.
# 3. The discord API is used to create the bot called query_bot which provides with coding solutions in the server itself.
